1
00:00:30,024 --> 00:00:33,319
We became idols today.

2
00:00:33,737 --> 00:00:37,240
And we're filming our glitter to create a movie.

3
00:00:37,240 --> 00:00:39,409
A self-supported idol movie.

4
00:00:39,409 --> 00:00:43,706
What the camera captures is
sparkles and timidity of our girlhood.

5
00:00:44,372 --> 00:00:46,165
And our purity.

6
00:00:46,959 --> 00:00:51,129
Let us tell our story as a movie.

7
00:00:54,107 --> 00:00:55,609
(Devotion to Cinema)

8
00:00:56,092 --> 00:00:59,095
An audition for maidens in love

9
00:00:59,095 --> 00:01:03,141
I'll apply for it in my birthday suit

10
00:01:03,851 --> 00:01:06,770
My specialty is
a blood-stained love letter

11
00:01:07,145 --> 00:01:10,106
I'm worried if you don't like it

12
00:01:11,567 --> 00:01:14,903
Taking a walk in shades with round shoulders,

13
00:01:15,236 --> 00:01:18,824
I feel like
I'm a pottery buried in soil

14
00:01:18,907 --> 00:01:22,243
Although I'm a girl
with a heart too timid,

15
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:27,290
We'll go location-scouting
of love in bare feet

16
00:01:30,586 --> 00:01:34,464
Please find me!

17
00:01:34,464 --> 00:01:38,259
And my dream without makeup

18
00:01:38,259 --> 00:01:42,014
If I don't show who I really am,

19
00:01:42,305 --> 00:01:46,100
It will just be a blooper

20
00:01:46,100 --> 00:01:50,063
Please look at
my real performance,

21
00:01:50,063 --> 00:01:53,859
Words of love in monotone

22
00:01:53,859 --> 00:01:57,946
Find them all in
the screen of your heart!

23
00:01:58,864 --> 00:02:03,451
Director and Story by Noboru Iguchi

24
00:02:09,082 --> 00:02:12,002
A few months ago

25
00:02:13,169 --> 00:02:18,174
Choo-choo, choo-choo...

26
00:02:18,174 --> 00:02:19,300
Wait!

27
00:02:19,467 --> 00:02:20,719
Don't leave me behind.

28
00:02:21,302 --> 00:02:23,889
Carry me in your memories.

29
00:02:25,598 --> 00:02:27,935
We cannot resist the torrent of time.

30
00:02:28,644 --> 00:02:30,813
You're no longer an existence on earth.

31
00:02:31,688 --> 00:02:32,689
As an evidence,

32
00:02:33,732 --> 00:02:35,901
I can't touch you even if I want to!

33
00:02:36,359 --> 00:02:40,279
Someone is holding me hard from the inside!

34
00:02:40,781 --> 00:02:42,281
NO!!

35
00:02:42,615 --> 00:02:43,659
I'll make it explode.

36
00:02:44,492 --> 00:02:45,535
BAAAANG!

37
00:02:56,629 --> 00:02:58,464
Well, can you play the scene up to here again?

38
00:02:59,007 --> 00:03:01,551
Hey, that "BAAANG" was awesome.

39
00:03:02,094 --> 00:03:03,261
What a nice ad-lib.

40
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:05,555
You perform everything heartily, Yoshie.

41
00:03:06,014 --> 00:03:08,809
It almost sounds sarcastic, Moe.

42
00:03:08,809 --> 00:03:11,061
Well, I just thought everything needs vigor.

43
00:03:11,352 --> 00:03:12,478
How was it?

44
00:03:12,938 --> 00:03:14,480
It was cute, but...

45
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,734
Yes, you could suppress it a little.

46
00:03:18,359 --> 00:03:21,697
Too much overacting may draw
the play into a wrong direction.

47
00:03:22,155 --> 00:03:25,701
Well, I thought emphasizing
will make it more understandable.

48
00:03:25,701 --> 00:03:28,286
I agree with you, Yoshie.

49
00:03:28,745 --> 00:03:32,665
Your lines are too difficult
to understand, President.

50
00:03:33,207 --> 00:03:35,626
I don't think I have to
make them understandable.

51
00:03:36,086 --> 00:03:38,296
I don't want to cheapen
the main character's feelings.

52
00:03:38,714 --> 00:03:44,594
I'm disgusted. It sounds like I'm the cheap one.

53
00:03:45,428 --> 00:03:48,140
No, you don't mean that, do you?

54
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:50,558
An acting that conveys nothing is meaningless.

55
00:03:51,935 --> 00:03:52,685
Do it again.

56
00:03:53,436 --> 00:03:56,189
I don't understand.

57
00:03:56,439 --> 00:03:57,607
Let's play the next scene.

58
00:03:58,691 --> 00:03:59,609
President.

59
00:04:00,234 --> 00:04:01,111
Can I have a word?

60
00:04:01,485 --> 00:04:02,320
What is it?

61
00:04:08,576 --> 00:04:09,327
What's up?

62
00:04:09,786 --> 00:04:13,040
Well, I'll quit the drama club
at the end of this month.

63
00:04:13,414 --> 00:04:14,124
Why?

64
00:04:14,624 --> 00:04:16,626
I can't tell you now.

65
00:04:16,626 --> 00:04:17,501
I'll send you a text.

66
00:04:17,836 --> 00:04:19,171
I want to hear it now.

67
00:04:19,337 --> 00:04:20,797
I'll send you a text later.

68
00:04:22,506 --> 00:04:25,802
Oh, what will become of our drama club?

69
00:04:26,219 --> 00:04:29,597
I'm surprised to hear Moe's quitting.

70
00:04:29,597 --> 00:04:34,644
Well, but I understand Moe's feelings.

71
00:04:34,644 --> 00:04:36,646
Our president is too arrogant.

72
00:04:37,271 --> 00:04:42,652
Although she criticizes our performances
a number of times, her script is only partially finished.

73
00:04:43,028 --> 00:04:43,569
No?

74
00:04:43,569 --> 00:04:44,654
Well, yes.

75
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:48,282
Well, Kazuko, you're our only junior.

76
00:04:48,282 --> 00:04:49,659
You're not quitting, do you?

77
00:04:49,659 --> 00:04:51,661
Well, but...

78
00:04:51,661 --> 00:04:53,872
I'm sorry for acting selfishly.

79
00:04:54,497 --> 00:04:56,792
But I'm taking Kazuko away with me.

80
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,046
A drama company of my acquaintance
will let us help them.

81
00:05:01,587 --> 00:05:02,755
Is that true?

82
00:05:02,755 --> 00:05:06,550
You too should be off with the president soon.

83
00:05:07,010 --> 00:05:09,805
Don't waste your adolescence in vain!

84
00:05:09,930 --> 00:05:11,807
What? What?

85
00:05:11,932 --> 00:05:13,474
What on earth is it?

86
00:05:13,809 --> 00:05:19,647
Oh, what're we gonna do?
We can't perform with only three members!

87
00:05:19,647 --> 00:05:21,649
Calm, please calm down.

88
00:05:21,649 --> 00:05:24,527
It's a punishment for our president.

89
00:05:24,945 --> 00:05:27,697
Her body is large, but her mind is
too occupied with small things.

90
00:05:28,031 --> 00:05:31,243
When our practice is finished,
she goes home without any follow-up.

91
00:05:31,742 --> 00:05:38,624
It's a punishment for her doing only
what she wants to do with her heart shut to anyone.

92
00:05:39,042 --> 00:05:42,963
And the president of the drama company is so great!

93
00:05:42,963 --> 00:05:44,338
Oh, I'm so curious!

94
00:05:44,338 --> 00:05:46,632
I love how he directs the plays
and he got many prizes.

95
00:05:46,632 --> 00:05:47,717
Bye.

96
00:05:48,218 --> 00:05:49,719
I'm really looking forward to it!

97
00:05:54,266 --> 00:05:57,560
What are you going to do, Akari?

98
00:05:59,938 --> 00:06:04,151
I partially understand
what our president wants to express,

99
00:06:04,775 --> 00:06:07,237
and I don't dislike her seriousness.
I'll follow her.

100
00:06:08,071 --> 00:06:09,822
Really?

101
00:06:10,282 --> 00:06:13,869
I agree with you if you say so.

102
00:06:13,869 --> 00:06:14,410
Really?

103
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:17,747
Sure, we've been together ever
since we were in junior-high.

104
00:06:17,747 --> 00:06:19,582
I'm so happy!

105
00:06:21,043 --> 00:06:22,919
I'm comfortable when you're beside me.

106
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:23,836
Me, too!

107
00:06:23,836 --> 00:06:25,838
I'm so glad!

108
00:06:26,505 --> 00:06:28,216
I'll be always with you, Akari!

109
00:06:37,017 --> 00:06:39,810
Akari, you're so warm!

110
00:06:58,997 --> 00:07:03,293
Today's math teacher,
the teacher who speaks with a slit...

111
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,462
The way he pronounces "s" is almost like...

112
00:07:07,089 --> 00:07:09,341
Can you understand what he's saying?

113
00:07:12,302 --> 00:07:14,930
I feel happy when I'm with Akari.

114
00:07:15,763 --> 00:07:19,351
We're laying a bet on
which of us will get a good husband,

115
00:07:19,767 --> 00:07:23,479
but all I want is to be with Akari for good.

116
00:07:23,896 --> 00:07:26,690
I think I understand everything about Akari.

117
00:07:27,109 --> 00:07:28,110
Everything.

118
00:07:42,415 --> 00:07:44,917
Well, is there someone?

119
00:07:46,211 --> 00:07:47,711
No, there's no one.

120
00:07:49,005 --> 00:07:49,713
Okay.

121
00:08:18,243 --> 00:08:22,122
Yoshie, are you still in the drama club?

122
00:08:22,122 --> 00:08:23,581
Yeah, sort of.

123
00:08:23,914 --> 00:08:27,002
Well, can you introduce some of the members?

124
00:08:27,835 --> 00:08:29,004
What do you mean?

125
00:08:29,379 --> 00:08:34,009
I've told you, one of my friends in the university
is filming independent movies.

126
00:08:34,342 --> 00:08:36,219
Well, I remembered.

127
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:41,349
She wants real high-school girls
to perform for one day.

128
00:08:43,767 --> 00:08:44,394
Nope.

129
00:08:44,935 --> 00:08:45,811
Why not?

130
00:08:46,271 --> 00:08:48,273
I'm not saying YOU have to perform.

131
00:08:49,441 --> 00:08:51,942
Well, it sounds quite tiresome,

132
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:54,737
and our club is too occupied for that.

133
00:08:55,113 --> 00:08:56,156
Find someone else.

134
00:08:59,867 --> 00:09:01,411
How dare you talk like that?

135
00:09:05,290 --> 00:09:06,665
Ouch!

136
00:09:06,999 --> 00:09:09,001
Stop it! What's that?

137
00:09:09,001 --> 00:09:11,003
It's tiresome for me, too!

138
00:09:11,879 --> 00:09:14,924
But I'm trying to set it up because she insists!

139
00:09:14,924 --> 00:09:17,219
Then why don't you turn it down?

140
00:09:17,635 --> 00:09:20,347
Attack me more, and I'll scream to call our dad!

141
00:09:24,725 --> 00:09:28,480
Yoshie, why don't you stop using
the Kansai dialect though you're in Tokyo?

142
00:09:29,064 --> 00:09:31,899
It's been three years
since you tumbled into this house.

143
00:09:31,899 --> 00:09:33,901
Your schoolmates will find you bothering.

144
00:09:35,861 --> 00:09:38,073
Get someone. Absolutely!

145
00:09:38,739 --> 00:09:40,783
I didn't tumble into this house!

146
00:09:41,243 --> 00:09:43,994
I had no choice because our mom died!

147
00:09:45,955 --> 00:09:47,581
It's so tough.

148
00:09:52,087 --> 00:09:56,341
President, this is a relief
until we get new members.

149
00:09:56,341 --> 00:09:58,759
Just take it easy. Easy.

150
00:09:59,635 --> 00:10:00,886
Akari!

151
00:10:00,886 --> 00:10:02,596
Thanks for coming!

152
00:10:02,888 --> 00:10:04,182
Long time no see.

153
00:10:06,642 --> 00:10:10,604
I'm Yoshie's elder sister, Keiko.
I appreciate everything you do for her.

154
00:10:12,022 --> 00:10:14,817
Your sister's kind and beautiful as ever!

155
00:10:14,817 --> 00:10:17,695
Oh, no, no. Don't be deceived.

156
00:10:18,238 --> 00:10:20,282
She's an angel only when she's outside.

157
00:10:21,283 --> 00:10:24,702
Yoshie, let me introduce Naomi.

158
00:10:25,495 --> 00:10:26,579
Naomi, are you ready?

159
00:10:26,704 --> 00:10:28,038
Yes, I'm coming soon.

160
00:10:28,498 --> 00:10:30,040
Is she the director?

161
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:34,296
Yuck, she looks exactly like
a classy student of an art university.

162
00:10:34,296 --> 00:10:36,298
I don't think I can get acquainted with her.

163
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,929
Nice to meet you. I'm Naomi Kunikida.

164
00:10:44,930 --> 00:10:48,851
I'm making pieces with Yoshie's sister
in the visual arts department.

165
00:10:49,352 --> 00:10:53,105
I wanted real high-school girls
to star in our latest movie,

166
00:10:53,105 --> 00:10:55,107
so I decided to call you.

167
00:10:55,442 --> 00:10:56,484
Thank you so much.

168
00:10:57,860 --> 00:10:59,903
Are you interested in movies?

169
00:10:59,903 --> 00:11:01,905
Yes, very much.

170
00:11:03,491 --> 00:11:04,825
How about you, Yoshie?

171
00:11:04,825 --> 00:11:07,162
Well, can I have a word?

172
00:11:07,579 --> 00:11:08,371
Go ahead.

173
00:11:08,371 --> 00:11:11,915
You call it a movie, but it won't be released
all over Japan, will it?

174
00:11:12,250 --> 00:11:13,876
It's just your assignment.

175
00:11:13,876 --> 00:11:14,877
Yoshie.

176
00:11:15,337 --> 00:11:16,338
Yes, it is.

177
00:11:17,004 --> 00:11:18,590
But I'll apply for the movie festival.

178
00:11:19,089 --> 00:11:20,342
Well, I have a question.

179
00:11:21,343 --> 00:11:23,677
Why does it have to be real high-school girls?

180
00:11:26,013 --> 00:11:28,807
I don't want to lie even if it's a movie.

181
00:11:29,975 --> 00:11:31,561
In this movie,

182
00:11:31,561 --> 00:11:35,939
I'd like to explore changes that occurs
when girls in their adolescence confront with each other.

183
00:11:36,815 --> 00:11:39,735
Like I observe fish in a fish tank.

184
00:11:41,571 --> 00:11:43,490
We're not fish.

185
00:11:43,864 --> 00:11:44,948
That's insulting.

186
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:45,658
Let's go!

187
00:11:46,201 --> 00:11:47,243
Hey, Yoshie!

188
00:11:49,787 --> 00:11:51,038
That's true!

189
00:11:52,499 --> 00:11:54,917
It may be just our assignment.

190
00:11:56,085 --> 00:12:01,840
But having contact with elders will be a good chance
to learn about yourselves that you don't know.

191
00:12:02,217 --> 00:12:03,468
No, Yoshie?

192
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:07,597
Read it.

193
00:12:18,023 --> 00:12:23,571
Oh, this script only describes the situation,
and almost everything is up to ad-libs!

194
00:12:23,655 --> 00:12:26,366
And it'll never finish within one day!

195
00:12:26,366 --> 00:12:28,992
My sister has deceived me!

196
00:12:30,453 --> 00:12:33,122
Did you all look at Naomi's eyes?

197
00:12:33,581 --> 00:12:36,875
I can't express it very well,
but they had a strange aura.

198
00:12:36,875 --> 00:12:38,210
I felt that, too.

199
00:12:38,794 --> 00:12:42,047
Her eyes had an mocking air,
as if they're saying "You can't do it."

200
00:12:45,884 --> 00:12:49,305
So I find turning down the offer is
a little humiliating.

201
00:12:49,305 --> 00:12:51,890
No, President. Don't be provoked by her!

202
00:12:52,267 --> 00:12:52,891
Okay?

203
00:12:57,480 --> 00:12:58,398
Aki!

204
00:12:58,398 --> 00:12:59,148
Aki?

205
00:13:02,277 --> 00:13:04,612
Wait! Wait!

206
00:13:07,449 --> 00:13:09,867
Oh, no. We've lost her.

207
00:13:10,618 --> 00:13:12,870
Hey, don't you worry?

208
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:16,499
I do worry, but it can't be helped.

209
00:13:17,459 --> 00:13:19,586
She can take care of herself.

210
00:13:20,085 --> 00:13:22,796
By the way, I'm feeling hungry.
Why don't you come to my house?

211
00:13:23,172 --> 00:13:25,174
Well, I have to go home....

212
00:13:25,592 --> 00:13:27,719
No, don't go home.

213
00:13:28,177 --> 00:13:29,429
Stay with me today....

214
00:13:30,346 --> 00:13:32,222
Oh, our staff got into the frame!

215
00:13:32,222 --> 00:13:35,225
Cut, cut! Let's check the film.

216
00:13:35,225 --> 00:13:37,186
Check the film.

217
00:13:37,811 --> 00:13:39,062
Please have some tea.

218
00:13:41,023 --> 00:13:43,735
You got in the frame, go that way!

219
00:13:44,151 --> 00:13:47,739
Oh, my sister's acting was so stiff.

220
00:13:48,113 --> 00:13:49,031
Was it?

221
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:52,075
Nice work!

222
00:13:52,075 --> 00:13:53,869
I feel nervous to play in front of a camera!

223
00:13:53,869 --> 00:13:54,704
But you were good.

224
00:13:54,704 --> 00:13:56,331
And there're so many staffs.

225
00:13:56,623 --> 00:13:58,248
You should have done it, President!

226
00:13:59,082 --> 00:14:00,376
No, I'll just pass.

227
00:14:00,376 --> 00:14:01,711
Sorry, can you do it again?

228
00:14:02,211 --> 00:14:03,921
You were looking at the lens for a moment.

229
00:14:03,921 --> 00:14:05,005
I'm sorry.

230
00:14:06,924 --> 00:14:07,717
Keiko.

231
00:14:09,677 --> 00:14:10,678
Keiko,

232
00:14:11,136 --> 00:14:15,015
such an overdramatic
but superficial acting is useless.

233
00:14:15,767 --> 00:14:16,975
Do you understand love?

234
00:14:16,975 --> 00:14:17,769
Yes.

235
00:14:17,769 --> 00:14:19,311
How is it different from fancy?

236
00:14:20,145 --> 00:14:21,814
I... I don't know.

237
00:14:22,357 --> 00:14:23,816
I only have a vague idea.

238
00:14:23,816 --> 00:14:26,569
Be a woman extremely afraid of love.

239
00:14:26,569 --> 00:14:28,862
Release more juice from your pores.

240
00:14:30,280 --> 00:14:33,826
Keiko, you have no loneliness flooding from your body.

241
00:14:34,744 --> 00:14:36,954
Dark stare, dark stare.

242
00:14:36,954 --> 00:14:37,913
Well, but...

243
00:14:38,247 --> 00:14:43,001
as I read the script,
I find my role ordinarily cheerful.

244
00:14:43,461 --> 00:14:45,463
If you think so, your reading is shallow.

245
00:14:46,548 --> 00:14:50,718
Looking at your acting is far less interesting
than looking at one's own private parts.

246
00:14:51,969 --> 00:14:52,720
Isn't that so?

247
00:14:56,139 --> 00:14:57,349
Expose yourself.

248
00:14:57,933 --> 00:14:59,686
Reveal your naked heart.

249
00:15:03,146 --> 00:15:04,691
Let's film another take.

250
00:15:04,691 --> 00:15:06,233
Yes.

251
00:15:09,945 --> 00:15:14,867
Yuck, this is the first morning of filming
and the atmosphere is already awful.

252
00:15:14,867 --> 00:15:15,993
Just unbelievable.

253
00:15:17,829 --> 00:15:21,290
Yoshie, you were laughing at me, weren't you?

254
00:15:26,421 --> 00:15:29,006
Scene five, cut two, take one.

255
00:15:29,006 --> 00:15:30,382
Ready, action!

256
00:15:32,342 --> 00:15:33,761
Maybe I'd better go home.

257
00:15:34,136 --> 00:15:36,723
No, please don't go!

258
00:15:42,604 --> 00:15:43,521
Cut!

259
00:15:44,814 --> 00:15:46,899
It was good... prostrating yourself.

260
00:15:47,274 --> 00:15:48,233
Quite agreeable.

261
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:49,985
Is it?

262
00:15:50,695 --> 00:15:52,614
Great, great. That prostrating was great.

263
00:15:53,322 --> 00:15:55,115
But let your role possess you more.

264
00:15:55,491 --> 00:15:58,620
Let the moment of your deepest despair possess you.

265
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:00,287
Ready, action!

266
00:16:00,287 --> 00:16:05,375
NO! DON'T GO!

267
00:16:05,835 --> 00:16:07,419
Ouch, please stop!

268
00:16:07,419 --> 00:16:10,213
That's it! Let's take off your pants of your heart.

269
00:16:10,213 --> 00:16:12,467
Pants, pants, yes, pants.

270
00:16:12,467 --> 00:16:14,886
Now, let your soul be completely naked!

271
00:16:15,595 --> 00:16:16,888
Don't go!

272
00:16:19,014 --> 00:16:20,182
Come on!

273
00:16:21,016 --> 00:16:22,184
Naked!

274
00:16:22,602 --> 00:16:24,186
Good, good, good, good!

275
00:16:24,604 --> 00:16:25,772
Further, further!

276
00:16:26,689 --> 00:16:27,774
That's it, that's it.

277
00:16:27,774 --> 00:16:29,191
Cut!

278
00:16:30,818 --> 00:16:31,819
That was close.

279
00:16:32,779 --> 00:16:34,864
Did you feel exactly like when you were despaired?

280
00:16:35,657 --> 00:16:37,032
When I was ten,

281
00:16:37,449 --> 00:16:41,203
my mother bought cake only for my younger sister.

282
00:16:41,788 --> 00:16:42,955
I recalled that.

283
00:16:43,956 --> 00:16:44,957
That's it.

284
00:16:46,291 --> 00:16:49,545
My sister is getting awful.

285
00:16:49,545 --> 00:16:51,756
And is Akari all right?

286
00:16:51,756 --> 00:16:55,885
Akari, let's act as forcefully as Keiko.

287
00:16:56,343 --> 00:16:56,761
Yes.

288
00:16:56,761 --> 00:16:58,805
Acting is like playing a catch.

289
00:16:58,805 --> 00:17:01,056
If your co-actor plays the masochist,
play the sadist.

290
00:17:01,056 --> 00:17:02,725
It's okay to hit her.

291
00:17:02,725 --> 00:17:04,351
Yes, I understand.

292
00:17:04,351 --> 00:17:06,521
OK, let's film one more take
before we wrap up.

293
00:17:06,521 --> 00:17:07,270
One more take!

294
00:17:09,649 --> 00:17:11,483
Final take!

295
00:17:11,943 --> 00:17:14,152
Ready, action!

296
00:17:16,656 --> 00:17:17,949
Maybe I'd better go home.

297
00:17:19,241 --> 00:17:20,283
No.

298
00:17:20,827 --> 00:17:24,121
I DON'T ACCEPT THAT!!

299
00:17:29,459 --> 00:17:30,628
Are you all right?

300
00:17:30,962 --> 00:17:32,295
DON'T TOUCH ME!

301
00:17:32,630 --> 00:17:38,218
OH, NO!

302
00:17:38,970 --> 00:17:40,763
My sister's broken!

303
00:17:42,724 --> 00:17:44,684
NO! NO!

304
00:17:44,684 --> 00:17:45,935
Are you all right?

305
00:17:47,854 --> 00:17:48,646
Don't stop her!

306
00:17:49,354 --> 00:17:50,313
Let her continue!

307
00:17:51,148 --> 00:17:54,986
NO!

308
00:17:56,319 --> 00:17:59,782
Director, Keiko's bleeding from her head!

309
00:18:03,368 --> 00:18:05,120
Cut!

310
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:09,416
That was great!

311
00:18:10,125 --> 00:18:12,335
Your acting was more compelling,

312
00:18:13,295 --> 00:18:16,381
and the way your skirt flapped was so good.

313
00:18:16,924 --> 00:18:17,884
Oh, yes?

314
00:18:18,550 --> 00:18:20,510
Although I ended up bleeding,

315
00:18:20,970 --> 00:18:24,097
you praise the way my skirt flapped.

316
00:18:26,058 --> 00:18:27,059
No.

317
00:18:28,019 --> 00:18:29,979
I said your acting was good.

318
00:18:29,979 --> 00:18:34,274
You praise the way my skirt flapped over me!

319
00:18:36,234 --> 00:18:40,990
A live action is inferior to mere cloth!

320
00:18:42,742 --> 00:18:44,534
I've told you, I don't mean that.

321
00:18:47,204 --> 00:18:48,706
Excuse me.

322
00:18:49,081 --> 00:18:50,708
As I'm bleeding from my head,

323
00:18:50,708 --> 00:18:53,920
- Can you call a taxi to take me to the hospital...
- Wait, wait.

324
00:18:53,920 --> 00:18:54,712
Take this.

325
00:18:54,712 --> 00:18:56,714
OK, let's change the location.

326
00:18:59,634 --> 00:19:00,635
That's no good.

327
00:19:01,218 --> 00:19:02,135
Akari!

328
00:19:04,096 --> 00:19:06,139
Are you all right?
Did I do unnecessary acting?

329
00:19:06,139 --> 00:19:08,100
Is it my fault?

330
00:19:08,100 --> 00:19:09,267
All right, all right.

331
00:19:09,811 --> 00:19:11,520
You don't have to worry, Akari.

332
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:13,981
OK? It's all right. Just calm down.

333
00:19:13,981 --> 00:19:17,484
Just breathe. Slowly.

334
00:19:17,484 --> 00:19:19,486
I'll go look for her.

335
00:19:23,156 --> 00:19:24,116
Sister?

336
00:19:25,575 --> 00:19:26,869
Sister!

337
00:19:35,627 --> 00:19:38,089
Sorry for saying that in a complicated way.

338
00:19:38,881 --> 00:19:43,094
Well, you directed the camera only to Akari....

339
00:19:45,805 --> 00:19:47,514
You misunderstand me.

340
00:20:30,099 --> 00:20:34,145
She and my sister were in
THAT sort of relationship....

341
00:20:34,145 --> 00:20:35,146
All right?

342
00:20:35,980 --> 00:20:37,148
Akari, don't see that.

343
00:20:37,148 --> 00:20:38,607
Don't hear that.
What's the matter?

344
00:20:38,607 --> 00:20:41,234
This is no good. Absolutely no good. Run!

345
00:20:41,234 --> 00:20:42,194
What's going on?

346
00:20:47,992 --> 00:20:50,535
Wait a minute. What happened, really?

347
00:20:51,746 --> 00:20:52,955
This movie is no good.

348
00:20:53,246 --> 00:20:54,581
Definitely no good.

349
00:20:54,581 --> 00:20:56,583
I'll make excuses, so just drop out of it.

350
00:20:56,583 --> 00:20:58,878
But some scenes are already completed,

351
00:20:58,878 --> 00:21:00,880
and I don't feel like giving up in the middle.

352
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:02,048
But...

353
00:21:02,464 --> 00:21:05,592
Also, I have a keener instinct than others do.

354
00:21:06,010 --> 00:21:09,638
Something tells me we should continue.
It's like a magnetic wave.

355
00:21:10,347 --> 00:21:14,101
I feel the contrary. I'm afraid.

356
00:21:14,643 --> 00:21:20,565
I fear something's gonna take you away.

357
00:21:23,318 --> 00:21:25,445
Why don't we stay in a family restaurant?

358
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:28,698
I don't want to meet my sister.

359
00:21:29,532 --> 00:21:31,953
Yes, of course. We're friends.

360
00:21:34,663 --> 00:21:35,664
Yoshie,

361
00:21:36,581 --> 00:21:40,211
I've kept it a secret,
but I really can see many things.

362
00:21:41,045 --> 00:21:44,673
My future, someone who's already passed away.

363
00:21:45,841 --> 00:21:48,844
A part of me believes that
such things will guide me.

364
00:21:59,230 --> 00:22:00,438
Oh, I just can't stand it.

365
00:22:02,066 --> 00:22:03,566
But it's fine with me.

366
00:22:03,818 --> 00:22:07,779
Because of that, I can be
close to you like this in your house.

367
00:22:09,739 --> 00:22:10,615
Cut!

368
00:22:12,534 --> 00:22:15,246
Okay, cut.

369
00:22:28,675 --> 00:22:33,014
What's this? I'm letting you use my house.
Don't put your luggage here!

370
00:22:43,858 --> 00:22:46,735
I'm sorry, I forgot to take your band-aid off.

371
00:22:47,069 --> 00:22:48,154
I'm gonna do it now.

372
00:22:48,695 --> 00:22:50,948
Hey, why are you taking it off?

373
00:22:51,073 --> 00:22:53,450
I thought it would make the scenes incoherent.

374
00:22:53,742 --> 00:22:54,869
This is okay.

375
00:22:54,869 --> 00:22:57,246
I don't want this movie to fit into ordinary categorization.

376
00:22:59,456 --> 00:23:02,667
I want to take things as they are into my piece.

377
00:23:03,169 --> 00:23:05,337
Besides, don't touch my actress without permission.

378
00:23:05,795 --> 00:23:07,089
All right.

379
00:23:07,089 --> 00:23:08,715
Do whatever you like.

380
00:23:09,466 --> 00:23:11,260
Sorry, may I interrupt?

381
00:23:13,720 --> 00:23:14,846
Akari.

382
00:23:15,347 --> 00:23:17,099
In the next scene....

383
00:23:19,476 --> 00:23:24,773
She may be thinking of your role as more than a friend.

384
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:26,358
Yes, I understand.

385
00:23:26,901 --> 00:23:31,197
She probably wants to get closer to you.

386
00:23:32,405 --> 00:23:33,908
I understand.

387
00:23:35,867 --> 00:23:38,703
Maybe she fancies your role.

388
00:23:39,579 --> 00:23:40,455
Yes.

389
00:23:41,999 --> 00:23:44,834
What's she gonna do to you?

390
00:23:46,795 --> 00:23:48,130
Well...

391
00:23:50,091 --> 00:23:53,219
A kiss... maybe....

392
00:23:55,054 --> 00:23:56,055
Yes.

393
00:24:00,184 --> 00:24:04,271
Show me your natural feeling,
how far you can accept.

394
00:24:09,276 --> 00:24:10,777
Okay, let's roll the camera.

395
00:24:10,777 --> 00:24:13,239
Yes.

396
00:24:19,869 --> 00:24:22,831
I have a bad feeling.

397
00:24:23,958 --> 00:24:26,001
Ready, action!

398
00:24:28,795 --> 00:24:33,466
Can you guess what I'm thinking of?

399
00:24:34,634 --> 00:24:36,011
Sort of.

400
00:24:39,431 --> 00:24:40,765
Shall I tell you?

401
00:24:41,976 --> 00:24:43,060
Yes.

402
00:24:45,728 --> 00:24:48,648
Akari, that's good. That's the way.

403
00:24:49,482 --> 00:24:50,985
That's the way to go. Great.

404
00:24:51,568 --> 00:24:52,652
This is no good.

405
00:24:53,112 --> 00:24:54,571
Why do you stop me!?

406
00:24:54,571 --> 00:24:55,447
No.

407
00:24:56,656 --> 00:24:58,367
Akari, that's good, that's good.

408
00:24:58,367 --> 00:25:00,952
Just go for it. That's it.

409
00:25:00,952 --> 00:25:02,579
Go on, go on.

410
00:25:03,580 --> 00:25:06,875
That's good, Akari. That's the way.

411
00:25:06,875 --> 00:25:08,877
That's the way to go.

412
00:25:08,877 --> 00:25:09,794
Just go for it.

413
00:25:12,381 --> 00:25:15,134
What's the matter?
Just continue, this is going very well.

414
00:25:17,635 --> 00:25:18,887
I can't.

415
00:25:18,887 --> 00:25:20,889
Just continue.
No!

416
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:24,393
Okay, cut.

417
00:25:25,894 --> 00:25:27,520
Let's change the mood and do it again.

418
00:25:27,979 --> 00:25:29,190
Wait a minute!

419
00:25:30,607 --> 00:25:32,151
Aren't you going too far?

420
00:25:32,775 --> 00:25:35,695
You made her play the kiss scene by leading questions.

421
00:25:36,197 --> 00:25:37,572
It's just ridiculous!

422
00:25:38,115 --> 00:25:38,781
Is it?

423
00:25:38,781 --> 00:25:41,618
It's natural if you're absorbed in your role's emotions.

424
00:25:41,951 --> 00:25:43,620
That's sophistry.

425
00:25:43,912 --> 00:25:46,081
You just want to make Akari kiss!

426
00:25:46,623 --> 00:25:47,582
Are you jealous?

427
00:25:47,582 --> 00:25:49,210
I'm not jealous!

428
00:25:49,626 --> 00:25:53,214
No one wants to see her sister
kissing her best friend in her own house!

429
00:25:53,630 --> 00:25:56,508
It has nothing to do with one who shoots a film.

430
00:25:57,259 --> 00:25:58,510
Does it?

431
00:26:03,057 --> 00:26:05,642
I couldn't kiss her,

432
00:26:06,352 --> 00:26:12,149
because I realized I'm just a tool
for filming such scenes.

433
00:26:12,358 --> 00:26:13,525
What are you saying?

434
00:26:13,816 --> 00:26:15,236
Keiko, you're an actress!

435
00:26:16,653 --> 00:26:18,364
Before being an actress,

436
00:26:19,448 --> 00:26:23,868
I'm your lover, Director!

437
00:26:25,329 --> 00:26:27,289
I'm the one you're going steady with!

438
00:26:31,584 --> 00:26:34,879
I can't play this role any more!

439
00:26:34,879 --> 00:26:36,881
I can't! I don't want to!

440
00:26:38,342 --> 00:26:40,177
Why are you laughing!?

441
00:26:40,469 --> 00:26:42,179
Come this way!

442
00:26:42,179 --> 00:26:44,348
Ouch! Let go of me!

443
00:26:44,348 --> 00:26:48,227
What do you want with me? Stop it, Sis!

444
00:26:51,397 --> 00:26:53,148
So, what are we gonna do?

445
00:26:53,148 --> 00:26:54,065
Yeah.

446
00:26:54,607 --> 00:26:56,193
We'll just go on, of course.

447
00:26:56,193 --> 00:26:57,902
Aren't you insane?

448
00:26:57,902 --> 00:27:00,406
How can we go on when the actress has dropped out?

449
00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:02,699
We still have an actress, the president of the drama club!

450
00:27:02,699 --> 00:27:04,701
What? Me?

451
00:27:06,661 --> 00:27:08,746
No, I've never performed as an actress!

452
00:27:08,746 --> 00:27:11,040
You don't need experience, if you have a sensitivity!

453
00:27:11,916 --> 00:27:15,086
Oh, I can't bear it any more!

454
00:27:15,086 --> 00:27:16,255
May I go home?

455
00:27:17,214 --> 00:27:18,507
Yes, you may.

456
00:27:19,841 --> 00:27:22,303
Male staffs are useless. They've no guts.

457
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:23,137
Wait.

458
00:27:23,137 --> 00:27:25,139
Only female staffs are to remain.

459
00:27:26,390 --> 00:27:27,890
Agreed?

460
00:27:29,851 --> 00:27:30,477
Yes.

461
00:27:31,437 --> 00:27:33,147
Hey, may I talk?

462
00:27:35,815 --> 00:27:36,941
Can you officially take part?

463
00:27:36,941 --> 00:27:38,193
We'll start filming now.

464
00:27:38,818 --> 00:27:39,819
But...

465
00:27:39,819 --> 00:27:41,280
We'll abandon what we've filmed so far.

466
00:27:41,904 --> 00:27:46,659
I want to make my movie a conceptual art
that changes in accordance with the situation.

467
00:27:47,328 --> 00:27:50,539
I have an instinct that
you can understand this role better.

468
00:27:52,207 --> 00:27:55,544
Maybe you can be who you truly are
in front of the camera.

469
00:27:56,878 --> 00:27:57,546
Can't you?

470
00:28:01,841 --> 00:28:04,135
Stop taking your anger out on me, Sis!

471
00:28:05,429 --> 00:28:07,847
Can you understand the agony of being a lesbian?

472
00:28:08,349 --> 00:28:11,684
Of seeing
the one you love lusting for someone else?

473
00:28:11,684 --> 00:28:12,769
I can!

474
00:28:13,270 --> 00:28:15,021
I'm feeling them right now.

475
00:28:16,315 --> 00:28:18,359
I may not be a lesbian,

476
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:20,402
but I'm feeling agony too!

477
00:28:21,027 --> 00:28:24,323
It's your bad habit to believe
you're the only one who's in pain!

478
00:28:30,828 --> 00:28:33,248
Ready, action!

479
00:28:35,209 --> 00:28:35,958
Well,

480
00:28:37,085 --> 00:28:38,295
Watashi...
(Female form of "I")

481
00:28:39,213 --> 00:28:40,297
No, boku...
(Male form of "I")

482
00:28:42,466 --> 00:28:44,884
I have gender identity disorder.

483
00:28:46,428 --> 00:28:47,804
Though I have a female body,

484
00:28:47,804 --> 00:28:49,264
my heart is a male's one.

485
00:28:50,890 --> 00:28:52,975
And I have fancied you as an opposite sex.

486
00:28:54,353 --> 00:28:55,978
I couldn't tell you for a long time.

487
00:28:59,566 --> 00:29:02,026
Is this your performance?

488
00:29:55,664 --> 00:29:56,707
Cut!

489
00:29:58,124 --> 00:30:00,209
OK!

490
00:30:01,336 --> 00:30:04,839
It was great!
I could see the bottoms of your hearts.

491
00:30:48,216 --> 00:30:50,552
Wait, Yoshie. Why do you ignore me?

492
00:30:50,552 --> 00:30:52,178
It was just a film shooting!

493
00:30:59,645 --> 00:31:00,395
Beware!

494
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:03,649
That trick won't do!

495
00:31:03,649 --> 00:31:04,899
Oh, yeah?

496
00:31:04,899 --> 00:31:06,901
Well, I do it too frequently.

497
00:31:08,194 --> 00:31:09,488
What have brought you here?

498
00:31:10,364 --> 00:31:11,239
Well....

499
00:31:11,823 --> 00:31:14,200
When Mom and our brother Asei
died in the accident...

500
00:31:15,159 --> 00:31:20,624
you resisted in tears,
insisting that you'd live in Osaka with grandma.

501
00:31:23,960 --> 00:31:27,213
I'm sorry for saying you tumbled into this house.

502
00:31:29,758 --> 00:31:31,593
You don't have to apologize.

503
00:31:32,761 --> 00:31:35,764
Asei was a funny brother.

504
00:31:36,431 --> 00:31:37,932
Hey, take a look.

505
00:31:40,017 --> 00:31:41,018
What is this?

506
00:31:41,687 --> 00:31:44,355
This is a movie Naomi directed three years ago.

507
00:31:44,897 --> 00:31:47,066
She wears our school uniform.

508
00:31:47,275 --> 00:31:49,902
Yeah, we all graduated from your school.

509
00:31:50,529 --> 00:31:52,989
Then why doesn't Naomi ask this actress to perform?

510
00:31:53,322 --> 00:31:54,533
It's impossible.

511
00:31:55,450 --> 00:31:57,368
She has been killed.

512
00:31:58,369 --> 00:31:59,454
Killed!?

513
00:32:00,162 --> 00:32:02,416
Her name is Ayano Kogure,

514
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,209
and she was three years senior to Naomi.

515
00:32:05,209 --> 00:32:09,548
Naomi was filming a parody of idol movies
with Ayano playing the lead.

516
00:32:10,006 --> 00:32:11,132
Look at another actress.

517
00:32:12,258 --> 00:32:14,010
This is Naomi!

518
00:32:14,010 --> 00:32:14,969
Yes.

519
00:32:15,554 --> 00:32:18,765
Naomi was filming the movie only with Ayano,

520
00:32:18,765 --> 00:32:21,225
but before the filming was completed,

521
00:32:21,267 --> 00:32:24,813
Ayano has been killed by her boyfriend
whom she wanted to break up with.

522
00:32:26,773 --> 00:32:28,024
This is it!

523
00:32:28,024 --> 00:32:33,112
I found the trump card to take a trick on Naomi!

524
00:32:34,448 --> 00:32:36,450
Yeah, it looks it's going well.

525
00:32:36,450 --> 00:32:38,117
That's the way, hang in there!

526
00:32:50,171 --> 00:32:52,883
OK? This is on your way back from school.

527
00:32:53,341 --> 00:32:55,802
You'll make certain your feelings toward each other.

528
00:32:56,385 --> 00:32:57,471
No lines required.

529
00:32:57,471 --> 00:33:00,891
Show your natural emotions.

530
00:33:05,102 --> 00:33:05,937
Yoshie?

531
00:33:06,688 --> 00:33:09,398
Hey, you two, what have brought you here
all of a sudden?

532
00:33:09,398 --> 00:33:11,400
Sorry to interrupt you during the filming.

533
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:13,402
My sister has some business with you.

534
00:33:13,402 --> 00:33:16,865
Maybe it's too late,
but I'd like to perform in your movie.

535
00:33:16,865 --> 00:33:18,867
I desperately want to.

536
00:33:19,576 --> 00:33:25,039
- Sorry, but half of the filming is finished.
- You said your movie can mutate, didn't you?

537
00:33:25,540 --> 00:33:31,588
If your movie is a conceptual art,
a new character would bring in unexpected turn of events.

538
00:33:31,588 --> 00:33:33,590
Yeah, you're right.

539
00:33:34,215 --> 00:33:36,175
But does everyone agree?

540
00:33:36,175 --> 00:33:36,968
Agree?

541
00:33:36,968 --> 00:33:38,512
Yes.

542
00:33:38,512 --> 00:33:41,180
I'd rather highly approve it.

543
00:33:42,014 --> 00:33:43,224
That settles it!

544
00:33:43,224 --> 00:33:44,350
Yeah!

545
00:33:45,560 --> 00:33:49,523
But it'll be an impromptu one-shot filming.
Don't stop acting.

546
00:33:50,607 --> 00:33:55,570
Okay, ready, action!

547
00:33:58,824 --> 00:33:59,533
Well...

548
00:34:00,449 --> 00:34:05,914
I hadn't expected I could be in
this sort of relationship with you.

549
00:34:06,957 --> 00:34:08,332
What sort of relationship?

550
00:34:10,292 --> 00:34:12,336
A relationship we can touch each other.

551
00:34:13,087 --> 00:34:16,215
We did touch each other, but I...

552
00:34:16,215 --> 00:34:21,512
You don't trust your heart with me
the way you trust your heart with her.

553
00:34:23,180 --> 00:34:24,766
It hurts me.

554
00:34:25,182 --> 00:34:27,018
That's for sure!

555
00:34:27,018 --> 00:34:29,688
I've been with her much longer than you.

556
00:34:29,688 --> 00:34:31,565
I wanna protect her.

557
00:34:31,565 --> 00:34:32,983
I wanna be her hero,

558
00:34:32,983 --> 00:34:35,484
or rather, her IDOL!

559
00:34:40,364 --> 00:34:41,742
That costume is...

560
00:34:42,158 --> 00:34:44,368
I found it in our clubroom.

561
00:34:44,661 --> 00:34:47,329
Hey, are you afraid of this costume?

562
00:34:47,748 --> 00:34:48,957
Your camera isn't running!

563
00:34:52,002 --> 00:34:53,837
Akari, let's film the next part!

564
00:34:54,545 --> 00:34:55,337
Wait!

565
00:34:55,337 --> 00:34:56,380
Where are you going?

566
00:34:56,840 --> 00:34:58,633
I want to film only with her!

567
00:34:58,633 --> 00:35:00,301
I want to make the picture best.

568
00:35:01,135 --> 00:35:03,304
And I brought a camera of my own!

569
00:35:08,100 --> 00:35:09,268
I won't let you do that!

570
00:35:09,853 --> 00:35:12,104
You can't film a movie
without the director's observation!

571
00:35:12,564 --> 00:35:18,569
Director, you want your actresses
to let her heart be naked, don't you?

572
00:35:19,320 --> 00:35:21,489
I think I can do it now.

573
00:35:21,990 --> 00:35:26,327
I feel the same way as you did
when you were filming that idol movie.

574
00:35:31,833 --> 00:35:33,167
No.

575
00:35:34,711 --> 00:35:36,963
That idol movie....

576
00:35:38,297 --> 00:35:39,590
NO!!

577
00:35:45,554 --> 00:35:48,016
Akari, are you all right?

578
00:35:48,599 --> 00:35:49,475
Yes.

579
00:35:51,602 --> 00:35:52,646
You can start.

580
00:35:53,647 --> 00:35:55,231
Okay.

581
00:35:56,398 --> 00:35:57,692
Now, take one.

582
00:35:59,653 --> 00:36:00,862
Here we go.

583
00:36:01,863 --> 00:36:02,864
Take one.

584
00:36:03,489 --> 00:36:05,157
Ready, action!

585
00:36:07,118 --> 00:36:08,244
Akari.

586
00:36:09,537 --> 00:36:13,207
Since I transferred to your junior-high,
I had been bullied.

587
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,626
But you'd protected me.

588
00:36:16,335 --> 00:36:17,628
Thank you.

589
00:36:19,089 --> 00:36:22,759
I would have killed myself if it hadn't been not for you.

590
00:36:23,927 --> 00:36:24,635
Really?

591
00:36:25,219 --> 00:36:26,470
It's a secret.

592
00:36:48,617 --> 00:36:50,327
Did you lick a throat candy?

593
00:36:51,287 --> 00:36:53,081
I feel so embarrassed.

594
00:37:24,403 --> 00:37:25,780
What's that?

595
00:37:38,667 --> 00:37:40,003
The kissing has started.

596
00:37:40,544 --> 00:37:41,629
I had a sort of instinct.

597
00:37:53,850 --> 00:37:55,101
You're so soft.

598
00:37:59,647 --> 00:38:00,689
You kiss me too much.

599
00:38:19,167 --> 00:38:20,292
I have lost.

600
00:38:22,003 --> 00:38:25,297
Director, she has turned me down.

601
00:38:26,590 --> 00:38:28,969
I'm done with this movie, so I'm leaving.

602
00:38:29,635 --> 00:38:31,553
Wait! Are you running away?

603
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:36,600
I'm not running away.

604
00:38:37,060 --> 00:38:38,519
I'm filming a new movie.

605
00:38:53,284 --> 00:38:56,204
I'm going to...

606
00:38:57,705 --> 00:39:01,042
I, a backseat player of the human race,

607
00:39:01,042 --> 00:39:04,503
will film a spin-off movie of me.

608
00:39:07,048 --> 00:39:10,384
I had, ever since I was born,

609
00:39:11,635 --> 00:39:13,512
I had lived as a female...

610
00:39:16,099 --> 00:39:19,227
with a quite uneasy feeling.

611
00:39:26,608 --> 00:39:29,070
My heart and my body contradict each other.

612
00:39:47,463 --> 00:39:48,505
When I get home,

613
00:39:48,505 --> 00:39:52,676
I change into clothes that I feel the most comfortable.
Men's clothes.

614
00:40:02,770 --> 00:40:04,064
Men's clothes.

615
00:40:06,648 --> 00:40:08,109
Hello?

616
00:40:10,070 --> 00:40:11,695
Do you have some time now?

617
00:40:15,283 --> 00:40:17,243
Do you remember the factory we went together?

618
00:40:18,410 --> 00:40:19,536
Yes.

619
00:40:22,207 --> 00:40:23,874
I want to talk with you about our future.

620
00:40:33,176 --> 00:40:37,388
She's the one who made fool of me.

621
00:40:37,888 --> 00:40:41,267
This is Kazuko in the first grade and Moe.

622
00:40:47,941 --> 00:40:50,859
Sorry to have called you all of a sudden.

623
00:40:51,527 --> 00:40:52,861
What is that camera?

624
00:40:54,239 --> 00:40:55,864
I brought this for filming.

625
00:40:55,864 --> 00:41:00,494
I'm gonna film the action you rejected
when I confessed my feelings long ago.

626
00:41:01,037 --> 00:41:04,623
What is it? It's revolting!

627
00:41:24,768 --> 00:41:25,853
I'm gonna kiss you.

628
00:41:25,853 --> 00:41:27,521
No! Stop...

629
00:41:34,320 --> 00:41:35,989
The kiss you rejected.

630
00:41:36,655 --> 00:41:38,699
This has made the movie mine.

631
00:41:42,619 --> 00:41:43,620
Stop!

632
00:41:55,716 --> 00:41:57,427
Looks like she's not answering.

633
00:41:58,011 --> 00:42:00,637
I wonder what's the matter with her.

634
00:42:02,931 --> 00:42:03,974
I'm worried.

635
00:42:12,649 --> 00:42:13,276
No!

636
00:42:18,031 --> 00:42:22,035
Sorry, but I need you to help me with the filming.

637
00:42:23,161 --> 00:42:25,330
I'll go on kissing you until you obey me!

638
00:42:32,170 --> 00:42:35,048
Akari, I have made a decision.

639
00:42:35,465 --> 00:42:38,759
I will kiss no one but you for the rest of my life.

640
00:42:41,262 --> 00:42:43,389
But you'll get married, won't you?

641
00:42:43,389 --> 00:42:46,100
Well, I'm not joking.

642
00:42:46,100 --> 00:42:50,771
I don't want to go out with a man any more.

643
00:42:51,272 --> 00:42:53,941
Even if I'll have no chance to kiss for the rest of my life,

644
00:42:54,900 --> 00:42:57,027
that's fine with me if I can save it for you.

645
00:42:57,945 --> 00:43:00,614
If I don't do so, I can't face Aki.

646
00:43:01,407 --> 00:43:03,784
Then I too will kiss no one but you, Yoshie!

647
00:43:04,327 --> 00:43:06,828
Oh, you don't have to do that.

648
00:43:24,138 --> 00:43:26,516
This is an offline edition of
what we've filmed so far.

649
00:43:26,516 --> 00:43:28,268
Thank you for your cooperation.

650
00:43:30,769 --> 00:43:33,647
Actually, I'm thinking of stopping filming of this movie.

651
00:43:34,148 --> 00:43:35,816
The production is to be aborted.

652
00:43:36,984 --> 00:43:39,279
Did you call us to say such a nonsense?

653
00:43:39,695 --> 00:43:44,825
If it continues like this,
this movie will only show girls flirting with each other.

654
00:43:45,451 --> 00:43:50,038
What? Do you mean our kiss is just flirting?

655
00:43:50,038 --> 00:43:52,040
We were much more serious about...

656
00:43:52,040 --> 00:43:54,042
Yoshie!
But there is no future.

657
00:43:54,042 --> 00:43:57,297
How dare you! After all, I just despise you!
Yoshie, stop!

658
00:44:00,133 --> 00:44:01,467
You're wrong.

659
00:44:01,883 --> 00:44:02,634
Huh?

660
00:44:03,261 --> 00:44:06,472
You can find something
only after filming what lies beyond kissing.

661
00:44:07,889 --> 00:44:11,352
When I kissed in front of the camera,
something in me has changed.

662
00:44:11,810 --> 00:44:14,688
I feel I've been saddled with
something I can't escape from.

663
00:44:15,689 --> 00:44:17,358
So does our president.

664
00:44:17,899 --> 00:44:20,736
Do you know that
she's not answering our phone calls?

665
00:44:21,404 --> 00:44:23,905
This movie has stirred everyone's fates!

666
00:44:24,574 --> 00:44:27,117
But I think I'd better delete this piece.

667
00:44:27,618 --> 00:44:28,578
No!

668
00:44:28,578 --> 00:44:30,288
Someone's telling me you mustn't.

669
00:44:33,166 --> 00:44:35,293
I heard the voice.

670
00:44:37,794 --> 00:44:38,837
Her voice!

671
00:44:42,216 --> 00:44:44,510
Wow, a psychic motion picture!

672
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:47,095
I have a rather strong extrasensory perception!

673
00:44:47,095 --> 00:44:48,096
Do you?

674
00:44:53,519 --> 00:44:54,978
This is...

675
00:44:55,521 --> 00:44:57,190
Ayano.

676
00:45:01,860 --> 00:45:05,989
Here we go. Ready, action!

677
00:45:14,873 --> 00:45:18,586
So, why are you filming a parody of idol movies?

678
00:45:18,586 --> 00:45:20,087
Do you like them?

679
00:45:20,087 --> 00:45:21,631
Uh, yes.

680
00:45:21,631 --> 00:45:26,760
I like the kids program you used to appear.

681
00:45:28,136 --> 00:45:29,888
Ah, when I was a child actress.

682
00:45:29,888 --> 00:45:32,350
Yes, so if I were to film a movie,
I wanted to film that sort of...

683
00:45:32,350 --> 00:45:34,935
Then, an impromptu dance will do?

684
00:45:35,478 --> 00:45:36,144
Yes.

685
00:45:40,899 --> 00:45:41,484
Shall I?

686
00:45:41,484 --> 00:45:42,150
Yes.

687
00:45:46,364 --> 00:45:49,492
Oh, it looks good, so good.

688
00:45:49,492 --> 00:45:53,329
Ayano had worked as a child actress and a model,
and I'd adored her in my high-school days.

689
00:45:54,162 --> 00:45:58,125
I thought, "If I were to make something
for the school festival, I'd film her."

690
00:45:59,084 --> 00:46:01,337
But Ayano had been famous for being selfish,

691
00:46:02,338 --> 00:46:05,508
and she tried to provoke me in every way.

692
00:46:06,049 --> 00:46:06,925
Let me use it!

693
00:46:08,553 --> 00:46:10,220
Okay! Dance!

694
00:46:10,804 --> 00:46:11,805
No.

695
00:46:11,805 --> 00:46:13,056
Do it now.

696
00:46:14,057 --> 00:46:16,644
- I don't want to.
- Hey, don't move!

697
00:46:16,644 --> 00:46:17,603
Quick.

698
00:46:17,603 --> 00:46:18,396
Go ahead.

699
00:46:19,896 --> 00:46:21,357
Shake your body more!

700
00:46:21,857 --> 00:46:23,191
More!

701
00:46:24,694 --> 00:46:26,153
Quick.

702
00:46:26,153 --> 00:46:27,697
Why are you sitting down?

703
00:46:28,614 --> 00:46:30,575
Shake your body more, much more.

704
00:46:33,369 --> 00:46:34,454
Looks good.

705
00:46:35,036 --> 00:46:37,582
Ayano had stirred whole the things completely.

706
00:46:38,874 --> 00:46:41,168
But I have no further movie materials.

707
00:46:43,296 --> 00:46:45,255
I'm sure I had filmed a lot more,

708
00:46:46,131 --> 00:46:48,175
so I think she must have deleted it.

709
00:46:51,261 --> 00:46:54,599
And I only have fragments of memories.

710
00:46:55,891 --> 00:46:57,851
I will never forgive you!

711
00:46:58,852 --> 00:47:02,147
"I will never forgive you,"
that's the final word of her I can recall.

712
00:47:04,107 --> 00:47:07,695
The next day,
Ayano was stabbed by her boyfriend and died.

713
00:47:11,156 --> 00:47:13,659
What happened during the gap of my memory?

714
00:47:15,285 --> 00:47:17,871
The thought of it still haunts me.

715
00:47:19,164 --> 00:47:23,586
That's why you tried to film
a continuation of your movie with Ayano,

716
00:47:24,378 --> 00:47:26,631
filming us as Ayano's substitutes.

717
00:47:27,507 --> 00:47:30,008
I only ended up in imitating Ayano,

718
00:47:30,967 --> 00:47:32,637
and I couldn't fill any gap.

719
00:47:33,136 --> 00:47:36,890
Then you have to complete the movie all the more.

720
00:47:38,141 --> 00:47:42,355
Unless you do so,
I cannot break up with you.

721
00:47:42,730 --> 00:47:47,693
You will continue playing your role to fill the gap.

722
00:47:48,318 --> 00:47:49,986
Let's film it together, all of us!

723
00:47:50,320 --> 00:47:51,112
Right?

724
00:47:51,697 --> 00:47:54,074
Well, there's no choice.

725
00:47:54,408 --> 00:47:59,329
Maybe our president and
the ghost of Ayano will come to us.

726
00:48:00,205 --> 00:48:00,997
Probably!

727
00:48:01,957 --> 00:48:02,667
Hey!

728
00:48:03,668 --> 00:48:05,210
Let's join our hands!

729
00:48:05,795 --> 00:48:07,879
I don't know exactly, but let's do it!
All right.

730
00:48:07,879 --> 00:48:08,631
Me too?

731
00:48:08,631 --> 00:48:09,715
Of course!

732
00:48:09,715 --> 00:48:12,300
Do our best!
Yeah!

733
00:48:13,927 --> 00:48:16,472
Okay, the camera is ready.

734
00:48:16,472 --> 00:48:17,473
Come in.

735
00:48:18,265 --> 00:48:21,309
I really don't like wearing this!

736
00:48:21,309 --> 00:48:24,020
Wow, it really suits Naomi!

737
00:48:24,020 --> 00:48:25,690
Suits her much better than you!

738
00:48:25,690 --> 00:48:28,900
I don't like wearing the same costume as her.

739
00:48:31,529 --> 00:48:33,363
So, Sis, what are we gonna you?

740
00:48:33,363 --> 00:48:36,074
Yoshie, you pretend to be Ayano and bully Naomi.

741
00:48:36,074 --> 00:48:37,577
What a rough direction.

742
00:48:38,243 --> 00:48:42,498
Oh! I sense Ayano's presence.

743
00:48:43,039 --> 00:48:44,834
She must be somewhere around here.

744
00:48:45,292 --> 00:48:47,002
Hey, where is she?

745
00:48:47,503 --> 00:48:49,589
Okay, act as if you let her possess you.

746
00:48:49,589 --> 00:48:51,965
Ready, action!

747
00:48:52,466 --> 00:48:53,967
I'm Ayano.

748
00:48:54,510 --> 00:48:56,887
Do you want me to bully her... like this?

749
00:48:56,887 --> 00:48:59,432
Ouch, it sores me!

750
00:49:00,558 --> 00:49:01,975
How dare you!

751
00:49:01,975 --> 00:49:03,477
Ouch!

752
00:49:03,477 --> 00:49:05,395
You're supposed to be unable to resist Ayano!

753
00:49:05,855 --> 00:49:08,023
You're still yourself, Yoshie. Do perform!

754
00:49:10,568 --> 00:49:11,985
Are you all right?

755
00:49:19,827 --> 00:49:22,120
Looks like Ayano has possessed your sister!

756
00:49:22,120 --> 00:49:23,997
Ayano, do you wanna tell us something?

757
00:49:24,874 --> 00:49:30,045
Film slight revealing of your pants.

758
00:49:32,005 --> 00:49:33,716
Slight revealing of our pants?

759
00:49:35,509 --> 00:49:37,218
Hey, let's show our pants slightly!

760
00:49:37,218 --> 00:49:39,054
Hey, hey!

761
00:49:39,054 --> 00:49:40,972
No, no, no, thanks.

762
00:49:40,972 --> 00:49:43,058
But what we've filmed so far lacks marketability.

763
00:49:43,058 --> 00:49:44,769
- You'll do it, too, Naomi!
- No, no. no. no.

764
00:49:44,769 --> 00:49:46,186
Quick, do it yourself.

765
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:47,938
Now.

766
00:49:50,775 --> 00:49:52,192
Good, good. Again!

767
00:49:54,152 --> 00:49:54,986
It was good!

768
00:49:55,445 --> 00:50:00,951
The deleted part definitely included
slight revealing of my pants that she forced me.

769
00:50:01,619 --> 00:50:03,411
Even after Ayano has become a dead,

770
00:50:03,829 --> 00:50:07,165
does she want to torture me sadistically?

771
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:12,045
Slight revealing of her pants... like this?

772
00:50:12,546 --> 00:50:14,674
Do it more!

773
00:50:15,256 --> 00:50:16,174
Like this?

774
00:50:16,174 --> 00:50:17,092
No!

775
00:50:17,092 --> 00:50:20,011
More!

776
00:50:20,387 --> 00:50:21,137
Like this?

777
00:50:21,137 --> 00:50:21,847
No!

778
00:50:22,180 --> 00:50:24,224
No.

779
00:50:24,809 --> 00:50:30,146
Idol costume... all of you.

780
00:50:30,690 --> 00:50:32,650
Idol costume, all of us?

781
00:50:51,627 --> 00:50:52,628
This is weird.

782
00:50:53,587 --> 00:50:56,549
Ayano probably has some sort of grudge against me,

783
00:50:56,882 --> 00:50:59,134
and attempts to punish me.

784
00:51:00,051 --> 00:51:04,139
But now, a strange sense of unity is growing among us.

785
00:51:04,139 --> 00:51:06,600
Here we go, show your pants!

786
00:51:06,600 --> 00:51:07,685
OK, OK, good, good.

787
00:51:07,685 --> 00:51:09,854
All right, have confidence!

788
00:51:09,854 --> 00:51:11,312
Here we go, show your pants!

789
00:51:11,312 --> 00:51:13,858
No!
OK, OK, good, good.

790
00:51:14,315 --> 00:51:16,401
Though I have a grudge against my ex-lover,

791
00:51:16,819 --> 00:51:19,195
I fill uplifted.... Is it because of the costume?

792
00:51:21,156 --> 00:51:25,745
No one in here had been thinking of becoming idols.

793
00:51:26,202 --> 00:51:29,957
I wish if Aki were with us as well.

794
00:51:30,583 --> 00:51:33,501
I wonder where she is right now.

795
00:51:40,843 --> 00:51:41,886
Here we go!

796
00:51:41,886 --> 00:51:42,595
Yes!

797
00:51:47,432 --> 00:51:48,893
Long time no see.

798
00:51:49,810 --> 00:51:51,478
Aki, Moe.

799
00:51:51,478 --> 00:51:53,480
What's this? Why are you dressed like that?

800
00:51:53,939 --> 00:51:55,190
It's been a while.

801
00:51:56,441 --> 00:51:58,986
I'm leading another group to film a spin-off movie.

802
00:52:00,029 --> 00:52:04,449
Now that I got my own clue members,
we're completely separated.

803
00:52:05,034 --> 00:52:06,451
We've been waiting for you,

804
00:52:06,451 --> 00:52:08,453
to complete the movie with you.

805
00:52:08,954 --> 00:52:13,333
Sorry, but we're in the middle of filming.
We'll shear right through you.

806
00:52:13,793 --> 00:52:15,836
Why do you say such a thing?

807
00:52:15,836 --> 00:52:17,170
Can't you come back to us?

808
00:52:17,587 --> 00:52:20,381
Your cells are different from ours.

809
00:52:21,008 --> 00:52:23,301
If you interrupt us, I'll hit you with this camera.

810
00:52:24,970 --> 00:52:26,221
Let us go.

811
00:52:26,221 --> 00:52:27,932
We're location-scouting, too!

812
00:52:50,328 --> 00:52:53,248
It's no use being sentimental.

813
00:52:53,749 --> 00:52:55,918
The climax of filming.

814
00:52:55,918 --> 00:52:57,920
Let's get there without stopping, Sis!

815
00:52:58,671 --> 00:52:59,964
Okay.

816
00:53:01,131 --> 00:53:04,927
Let's replicate the things at our school,
where Naomi had filmed Ayano.

817
00:53:05,426 --> 00:53:06,929
That's the only way. Let's go!

818
00:53:07,554 --> 00:53:08,346
Yeah!

819
00:53:19,524 --> 00:53:21,568
Quick, quick. This way, this way.

820
00:53:41,421 --> 00:53:44,925
In costumes like them,
it's only a matter of time before they're reported.

821
00:53:45,466 --> 00:53:48,344
Why don't we double-book our filming?

822
00:53:48,636 --> 00:53:51,472
We've gathered about ten extras on Twitter.

823
00:53:51,974 --> 00:53:53,224
Okay, let's go.

824
00:53:53,558 --> 00:53:54,350
Yes.

825
00:54:00,941 --> 00:54:03,068
Yuck, I hear footsteps.

826
00:54:10,366 --> 00:54:13,162
He's gone. Now!

827
00:54:22,629 --> 00:54:24,173
Akari, get the camera ready.

828
00:54:24,173 --> 00:54:24,965
Okay.

829
00:54:24,965 --> 00:54:26,591
Sis, close the door.
Yes.

830
00:54:30,637 --> 00:54:31,387
I closed it.

831
00:54:31,387 --> 00:54:33,264
The camera has been set up.

832
00:54:34,016 --> 00:54:35,266
Here we go.

833
00:54:35,600 --> 00:54:38,728
I'll try to torture you without being bashful.

834
00:54:38,728 --> 00:54:41,564
So that Ayano will possess me.

835
00:54:42,149 --> 00:54:45,819
I'll do my best to recall
all the memories I lost, too.

836
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:49,073
Let's complete the movie
and break free from the curse on us!

837
00:54:50,032 --> 00:54:51,241
So, here we go!

838
00:54:52,117 --> 00:54:54,203
Ready, action!

839
00:54:54,203 --> 00:54:55,120
Clap!

840
00:54:56,830 --> 00:55:02,752
If you're an idol,
why don't you reveal your pants slightly?

841
00:55:03,045 --> 00:55:05,630
For example, like this!

842
00:55:05,630 --> 00:55:08,424
No! It's so embarrassing!

843
00:55:08,884 --> 00:55:10,385
Further, like this!

844
00:55:10,385 --> 00:55:13,097
I feel so embarrassed!

845
00:55:14,347 --> 00:55:15,390
Okay, once again.

846
00:55:20,436 --> 00:55:22,730
The way you feel bashful looks so nice.

847
00:55:22,730 --> 00:55:25,025
I'm sure you can go further.

848
00:55:26,651 --> 00:55:32,782
The way Yoshie tortures me is
getting a lot closer to Ayano.

849
00:55:33,324 --> 00:55:34,910
Let's recall what happened next.

850
00:55:36,078 --> 00:55:38,663
I'm sure she did something more terrible to me.

851
00:55:40,249 --> 00:55:47,630
Why am I directing a reflector board
to my sister turning over my ex-lover's skirt?

852
00:55:48,173 --> 00:55:50,009
For what have I lived so far?

853
00:55:50,758 --> 00:55:53,720
What was the meaning of Ayano's short life?

854
00:55:56,556 --> 00:55:58,391
Let's do it again!

855
00:55:58,391 --> 00:56:00,102
You're too persistent!

856
00:56:00,102 --> 00:56:02,478
I'm not persistent, let's do it again!

857
00:56:07,734 --> 00:56:08,526
It happened again!

858
00:56:09,402 --> 00:56:11,155
What's your next direction?

859
00:56:14,992 --> 00:56:20,621
School... swimsuits....

860
00:56:21,831 --> 00:56:23,624
All... of... you....

861
00:56:24,126 --> 00:56:26,253
You want us to wear school swimsuits?

862
00:56:26,253 --> 00:56:28,922
We must have some extra school swimsuits
in the changing room.

863
00:56:29,256 --> 00:56:30,506
That's it! Let's go!

864
00:56:41,642 --> 00:56:42,435
What's this?

865
00:56:43,062 --> 00:56:43,811
What're you doing?

866
00:56:44,354 --> 00:56:47,024
We're going to kiss you.

867
00:56:49,442 --> 00:56:50,110
Here we go.

868
00:57:05,209 --> 00:57:06,501
Akari!

869
00:57:06,501 --> 00:57:09,712
Hurry to change into school swimsuits, quick!

870
00:57:09,712 --> 00:57:13,883
- Let's go, we must change first.
- No, why does this has to...

871
00:57:14,467 --> 00:57:15,802
Here, this is your reward.

872
00:57:15,802 --> 00:57:17,262
Thank you so much!

873
00:57:17,512 --> 00:57:20,890
- This is just like a hidden camera show.
Go ahead and kiss a lot! - Yes.

874
00:57:21,225 --> 00:57:22,892
Here.
Thanks a lot.

875
00:57:22,892 --> 00:57:24,477
Three thousand yen for one kiss.

876
00:57:24,477 --> 00:57:28,148
Three thousand yen!?
I'll do my best revealing my bikini!

877
00:57:28,148 --> 00:57:29,274
Please work a little more!

878
00:57:30,775 --> 00:57:32,986
Here they are, school swimsuits!

879
00:57:33,486 --> 00:57:34,779
Indeed.

880
00:57:34,779 --> 00:57:36,447
Okay, let's change into them!

881
00:57:36,906 --> 00:57:37,615
Yes.

882
00:57:37,950 --> 00:57:41,120
No! Please, someone, help me!

883
00:57:41,911 --> 00:57:43,288
NO!!

884
00:57:49,669 --> 00:57:50,920
Aki....

885
00:57:52,089 --> 00:57:54,882
Won't you perform in my movie?
I'll make you the heroine.

886
00:57:55,800 --> 00:57:57,094
Stop that.

887
00:57:57,094 --> 00:58:00,305
Stop it. I don't want to drop out in the middle.

888
00:58:00,638 --> 00:58:03,516
You're still one of the main casts of our movie, Aki.

889
00:58:06,644 --> 00:58:09,273
Why don't you join us again in the school swimsuit?

890
00:58:09,730 --> 00:58:13,152
Filming with your friends is a lot more fun
than filming on your own.

891
00:58:23,036 --> 00:58:25,705
No, it's so embarrassing!

892
00:58:25,705 --> 00:58:28,749
Oh, wearing a swimsuit is so embarrassing!

893
00:58:28,749 --> 00:58:31,502
Me, too. But we have to film the next part!

894
00:58:32,296 --> 00:58:32,962
Yes!

895
00:58:41,721 --> 00:58:43,473
Start performing at once!

896
00:58:43,473 --> 00:58:44,974
Ready, action!

897
00:58:46,351 --> 00:58:49,104
That school swimsuit suits you.

898
00:58:49,479 --> 00:58:52,482
No, it's so embarrassing that I can't bear it!

899
00:58:56,819 --> 00:58:59,489
Okay, here we go.

900
00:59:04,702 --> 00:59:07,080
Hey, take off your hands.

901
00:59:07,622 --> 00:59:08,915
It's already being filmed.

902
00:59:09,458 --> 00:59:12,835
It's good, you look so cute. Smile!

903
00:59:13,378 --> 00:59:15,172
Hey, why don't you smile?

904
00:59:17,132 --> 00:59:18,925
It's too embarrassing to do.

905
00:59:20,385 --> 00:59:22,720
Yes, this is the feeling.

906
00:59:23,305 --> 00:59:26,225
Though the school swimsuit
had already brought me to my limit,

907
00:59:26,225 --> 00:59:28,227
Ayano provoked me further.

908
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:32,314
Hey, how is it?

909
00:59:33,981 --> 00:59:35,858
It's good. You look so cute.

910
00:59:35,858 --> 00:59:39,238
Then I lost my reason and...

911
00:59:59,590 --> 01:00:01,008
I wanna kiss you.

912
01:00:10,519 --> 01:00:12,770
No, I can't.

913
01:00:13,688 --> 01:00:18,360
I decided I'll kiss only one person
for the rest of my life.

914
01:00:21,070 --> 01:00:23,990
The one I can kiss is not you.

915
01:00:25,074 --> 01:00:25,992
Do you understand?

916
01:00:28,495 --> 01:00:31,747
No. No!

917
01:00:33,624 --> 01:00:36,253
Stop, Yoshie! Don't torture Naomi further!

918
01:00:42,342 --> 01:00:43,968
I remembered!

919
01:00:44,303 --> 01:00:45,595
Everything.

920
01:00:46,095 --> 01:00:47,930
I remembered everything!

921
01:00:49,349 --> 01:00:50,434
What's the matter?

922
01:00:50,766 --> 01:00:52,394
Naomi!
Get out of my way!

923
01:00:55,813 --> 01:00:58,691
Maybe I have hurt her.

924
01:01:05,449 --> 01:01:06,616
There she is!

925
01:01:22,549 --> 01:01:26,636
Hey... what's the matter?

926
01:01:27,928 --> 01:01:30,265
Well, have you become serious?

927
01:01:31,682 --> 01:01:34,935
I only teased you, what a fool you are.

928
01:01:34,935 --> 01:01:36,646
Hey, look at the camera again.

929
01:01:37,855 --> 01:01:39,023
Quick.

930
01:01:40,107 --> 01:01:42,611
Hey, look at the camera.

931
01:01:42,611 --> 01:01:44,613
Hey, do look at the camera.

932
01:01:46,323 --> 01:01:47,657
It's so good.

933
01:02:12,641 --> 01:02:16,520
With all the memories having recalled,
I got confused.

934
01:02:17,437 --> 01:02:21,148
Because I had known Ayano had a male lover...

935
01:02:21,608 --> 01:02:27,029
Yes. I'm filming a movie with my junior, Naomi.

936
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:30,617
Hey!

937
01:02:30,617 --> 01:02:33,077
Hello, Koji. This is Naomi.

938
01:02:33,620 --> 01:02:35,788
Thanks for being with me till morning the other day.

939
01:02:37,748 --> 01:02:40,000
Hey, what do you mean?

940
01:02:41,586 --> 01:02:46,048
- Why do you know Koji?
- Because I was jealous of Ayano,

941
01:02:46,508 --> 01:02:48,427
I stole Koji from her.

942
01:02:54,765 --> 01:02:59,354
Look, this is Ayano's face in fury.

943
01:03:05,860 --> 01:03:07,612
I will...

944
01:03:09,489 --> 01:03:11,283
never forgive you.

945
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:18,707
I'll never forgive you!

946
01:03:22,084 --> 01:03:23,420
I had been...

947
01:03:26,298 --> 01:03:28,215
fond of you!

948
01:03:33,680 --> 01:03:36,308
At the night when I cast a malice like this on her,

949
01:03:37,309 --> 01:03:39,852
Ayano had a quarrel with her boyfriend,

950
01:03:40,312 --> 01:03:42,229
and was stabbed to death.

951
01:03:46,275 --> 01:03:48,737
I had practically killed her.

952
01:03:49,945 --> 01:03:55,242
Ayano wants me to make atonement for this.

953
01:04:07,213 --> 01:04:08,839
I know it.

954
01:04:11,258 --> 01:04:15,095
I know the best ending for this movie is my death.

955
01:04:20,976 --> 01:04:23,396
I got the camera ready.

956
01:04:29,361 --> 01:04:30,152
Yoshie.

957
01:04:32,697 --> 01:04:34,783
Go, please.

958
01:04:35,157 --> 01:04:37,159
Go and kiss Naomi.

959
01:04:39,119 --> 01:04:43,458
I think your kiss to her will complete this movie.

960
01:04:43,999 --> 01:04:45,209
But...

961
01:04:45,209 --> 01:04:47,712
I've decided that I will kiss no one but you,

962
01:04:48,254 --> 01:04:51,048
and I don't fancy Naomi.

963
01:04:51,466 --> 01:04:54,343
Then you can love her instead of fancying her.

964
01:04:54,969 --> 01:04:59,181
I believe one kiss will release Naomi from the past.

965
01:05:00,099 --> 01:05:02,435
All I have to do is to go beyond the reality, right?

966
01:05:02,977 --> 01:05:04,854
All I have to do is perform Ayano...

967
01:05:04,854 --> 01:05:07,022
to forgive Naomi!

968
01:05:07,022 --> 01:05:08,608
Yes, forgive her with a kiss.

969
01:05:08,608 --> 01:05:10,150
I'll charge my love to you.

970
01:05:11,318 --> 01:05:12,737
Okay, here we go!

971
01:05:29,378 --> 01:05:30,589
I hate this!

972
01:05:46,646 --> 01:05:49,315
No, stop it!

973
01:05:50,399 --> 01:05:52,694
Hey, help me!

974
01:05:52,694 --> 01:05:56,196
Stop it, Yoshie, Yoshie!

975
01:06:02,995 --> 01:06:03,705
Wait!

976
01:06:06,081 --> 01:06:08,627
Stop it, don't touch my club members!

977
01:06:09,628 --> 01:06:10,545
Aki.

978
01:06:31,524 --> 01:06:34,318
Akari.

979
01:06:46,915 --> 01:06:48,457
Leave them to me.

980
01:06:51,126 --> 01:06:53,797
The role to protect Yoshie needs to be played by me.

981
01:06:54,213 --> 01:06:54,881
Thanks.

982
01:06:54,881 --> 01:06:55,965
Thank you.

983
01:07:08,895 --> 01:07:11,940
No! I mustn't be possessed by the ghost!

984
01:07:12,314 --> 01:07:13,107
Naomi!

985
01:07:14,316 --> 01:07:16,861
Reveal your pants slightly!

986
01:07:19,363 --> 01:07:21,825
The ghost possesses me when I turn to Naomi!

987
01:07:21,825 --> 01:07:23,535
I can't help her!

988
01:07:24,076 --> 01:07:25,244
Yoshie!

989
01:07:26,495 --> 01:07:27,539
Yoshie!

990
01:07:27,539 --> 01:07:28,748
Sister!

991
01:07:29,708 --> 01:07:31,876
Quick, use this camera,

992
01:07:31,876 --> 01:07:33,502
and kiss Naomi!

993
01:07:34,128 --> 01:07:37,006
I had once wished Naomi's death,

994
01:07:37,381 --> 01:07:39,508
but when she's actually dying,
I don't want her to.

995
01:07:40,092 --> 01:07:45,055
Even if she's to be kissed by my sister,
I'd rather want her to if she will be saved.

996
01:07:46,348 --> 01:07:48,810
The fight against the ghost has told me...

997
01:07:49,309 --> 01:07:52,396
that this is love.

998
01:07:55,482 --> 01:07:59,194
Sis, is this love?

999
01:07:59,194 --> 01:08:00,989
I can feel it!

1000
01:08:07,036 --> 01:08:09,581
Yoshie, quick!

1001
01:08:11,540 --> 01:08:12,834
Thanks, everyone.

1002
01:08:13,292 --> 01:08:16,295
All the jealousy and grudge have gone.

1003
01:08:16,713 --> 01:08:19,214
And only love remains!

1004
01:08:32,269 --> 01:08:35,899
Yoshie, we'll handle all the kisses here!

1005
01:08:50,079 --> 01:08:52,832
All right, all right....

1006
01:08:53,248 --> 01:08:55,209
I'll hang myself.

1007
01:08:55,794 --> 01:08:57,962
I'll hang myself!

1008
01:09:11,391 --> 01:09:15,521
Don't do that!

1009
01:09:19,441 --> 01:09:21,861
NO!!

1010
01:09:22,862 --> 01:09:27,157
No, I won't let them arrive at a happy ending!

1011
01:09:36,208 --> 01:09:37,126
Wait!

1012
01:10:14,038 --> 01:10:18,126
Naomi!

1013
01:10:25,925 --> 01:10:28,928
Naomi, you mustn't die.

1014
01:10:30,054 --> 01:10:33,099
I will not be able to quarrel with you,

1015
01:10:34,142 --> 01:10:35,727
and I don't dislike you.

1016
01:11:31,032 --> 01:11:33,700
Naomi, I have realized.

1017
01:11:34,243 --> 01:11:37,371
Ayano doesn't want to torture you.

1018
01:11:37,830 --> 01:11:42,126
She wanted you to be released
from the trauma of the sense of guilt.

1019
01:12:17,661 --> 01:12:21,207
I'll just try to live for now.

1020
01:12:24,501 --> 01:12:26,586
I think that's a good idea.

1021
01:12:56,242 --> 01:13:00,370
Okay, cut!

1022
01:13:01,371 --> 01:13:04,624
Okay, all the filming has been completed!

1023
01:13:05,126 --> 01:13:07,962
Great!

1024
01:13:10,672 --> 01:13:12,632
Congratulations!

1025
01:13:15,136 --> 01:13:16,553
Yes!

1026
01:13:17,180 --> 01:13:18,805
Yeah!

1027
01:13:22,684 --> 01:13:26,563
Sis, Akari, thanks a lot!

1028
01:13:27,106 --> 01:13:29,399
I think I got rid of the ghost.

1029
01:13:29,399 --> 01:13:31,110
Oh, that's good.

1030
01:13:33,528 --> 01:13:35,655
I'm relieved!

1031
01:13:35,655 --> 01:13:37,116
I've been so worried!

1032
01:13:42,704 --> 01:13:43,915
It was a great success!

1033
01:13:58,428 --> 01:13:59,554
Senpai.

1034
01:14:01,515 --> 01:14:02,766
I brought the camera.

1035
01:14:03,267 --> 01:14:04,102
Let's film it together.

1036
01:14:11,067 --> 01:14:12,235
It's not focused.

1037
01:14:15,695 --> 01:14:17,365
Oh, now it's focused.
It looks nice.

1038
01:14:19,783 --> 01:14:21,160
Yeah!

1039
01:14:21,160 --> 01:14:22,786
Yeah.

1040
01:14:23,703 --> 01:14:26,207
We're meeting during the break.

1041
01:14:29,626 --> 01:14:30,752
What shall we do?

1042
01:14:30,752 --> 01:14:32,754
What shall we do?
Today?

1043
01:14:52,441 --> 01:14:53,859
Okay, this is our final part.

1044
01:14:54,277 --> 01:14:56,404
Hey, what are you gonna do next?

1045
01:14:56,945 --> 01:14:58,655
This is our idol movie,

1046
01:14:59,365 --> 01:15:02,909
so we'll film a curtain call of our gratitude.

1047
01:15:03,202 --> 01:15:05,495
If you're idols, don't you have to wear makeup?

1048
01:15:05,745 --> 01:15:06,538
We don't have to,

1049
01:15:06,955 --> 01:15:08,332
because we are...

1050
01:15:08,748 --> 01:15:09,624
Together!

1051
01:15:09,958 --> 01:15:11,626
We're No Makes!

1052
01:15:20,219 --> 01:15:21,179
Let's salute!

1053
01:15:26,100 --> 01:15:30,979
I'm humbled for being like this

1054
01:15:31,272 --> 01:15:37,028
Though there're hundreds of
millions of girls in the world

1055
01:15:37,028 --> 01:15:41,531
I'm sorry for being a little subservient

1056
01:15:42,033 --> 01:15:46,370
A pose of gratitude to your warm heart

1057
01:15:46,370 --> 01:15:48,331
Yes, salute, salute!

1058
01:15:52,126 --> 01:15:53,211
Yes, salute!

1059
01:15:57,298 --> 01:15:58,466
Yes, salute!

1060
01:15:58,757 --> 01:16:02,928
I salute every time,
I show respect everywhere

1061
01:16:03,471 --> 01:16:06,723
I voluntarily ban
it from time to time

1062
01:16:07,183 --> 01:16:08,476
I have to self-control!

1063
01:16:08,767 --> 01:16:13,439
I give my loyalty to your favors

1064
01:16:13,897 --> 01:16:16,816
Yes, salute!
A profound salute!

1065
01:16:17,193 --> 01:16:19,694
I salute every time!

1066
01:16:19,694 --> 01:16:22,614
I show respect everywhere,
I make a silent prayer occasionally

1067
01:16:23,282 --> 01:16:24,616
A silent prayer?

1068
01:16:24,908 --> 01:16:29,955
I'm gonna protect you

1069
01:16:30,456 --> 01:16:33,292
A one-to-one battle of fancies

1070
01:16:33,292 --> 01:16:35,253
Yes, salute! Salute!

1071
01:16:35,710 --> 01:16:38,256
Sa-lu-lute! Love! Love, love, yeah!

1072
01:16:38,256 --> 01:16:39,714
Fancies! Come, come, yeah!

1073
01:16:39,714 --> 01:16:41,049
Bring it on me!

1074
01:16:41,049 --> 01:16:43,552
Sa-lu-lute! Love! Love, love, yeah!

1075
01:16:43,552 --> 01:16:45,053
Fancies! Come, come, yeah!

1076
01:16:45,554 --> 01:16:47,055
Yes, salute!

1077
01:16:49,015 --> 01:16:58,234
I had thought it's a sin for
someone like me to fall in love

1078
01:16:59,318 --> 01:17:04,823
To me who don't fit
in the world of love and fancies

1079
01:17:05,241 --> 01:17:10,288
You have given a smile

1080
01:17:10,454 --> 01:17:15,750
You have the kindest
heart in the world

1081
01:17:15,750 --> 01:17:18,296
I toss you into the air
before knowing it

1082
01:17:18,546 --> 01:17:21,340
And show you a pose of respect

1083
01:17:22,674 --> 01:17:24,884
Yes, salute! Salute!

1084
01:17:26,094 --> 01:17:31,016
I'm humbled for being like this

1085
01:17:31,309 --> 01:17:36,980
Though there're hundreds of
millions of girls in the world

1086
01:17:36,980 --> 01:17:41,735
I'm sorry for being
a little subservient

1087
01:17:42,153 --> 01:17:46,449
A pose of gratitude to
your warm heart

1088
01:17:46,449 --> 01:17:48,200
Yes, salute, salute!

1089
01:17:51,953 --> 01:17:53,247
Yes, salute!

1090
01:18:13,725 --> 01:18:20,358
The screen comes to an end

1091
01:18:20,399 --> 01:18:28,948
to a trashy film
leaving a trail of warmth

1092
01:18:30,075 --> 01:18:40,586
the audience begins to leave
a dazzling glow

1093
01:18:41,253 --> 01:18:46,258
left behind

1094
01:18:46,883 --> 01:18:54,308
don't get up during credit rolls

1095
01:18:55,351 --> 01:19:02,816
because the vision remains smiling

1096
01:19:03,191 --> 01:19:10,782
if only you could stay and watch me

1097
01:19:10,865 --> 01:19:20,543
from the film's end
shall tomorrow come

1098
01:19:20,709 --> 01:19:28,384
every one of us plays
the lead of a role called "myself"

1099
01:19:28,509 --> 01:19:36,684
a roadshow without a release

1100
01:19:37,225 --> 01:19:46,234
still the film goes on

1101
01:19:50,573 --> 01:19:58,497
don't get up during credit rolls

1102
01:19:59,080 --> 01:20:06,672
the past shivers

1103
01:20:07,213 --> 01:20:14,597
if only you could look and find me

1104
01:20:15,138 --> 01:20:22,937
hiding love in this trifle ending

1105
01:20:23,021 --> 01:20:30,404
don't get up during credit rolls

1106
01:20:31,154 --> 01:20:38,579
don't leave me alone

1107
01:20:39,120 --> 01:20:46,545
if only you could stay and watch me

1108
01:20:46,795 --> 01:20:54,762
from the film's end
shall tomorrow come

1109
01:20:55,178 --> 01:21:08,066
from the film's end
tomorrow will come

1110
01:21:09,108 --> 01:21:14,113
